# The-Food-Delivery-System
“The Online Food Delivery System” has been designed for Fast Food restaurant, Take-Away or College Cafeterias. 
 The system can also be used in any food delivery
industry. This simplifies the process of food ordering and delivering for both the customer and
the restaurant, as the entire process of taking orders and processing it to the delivery boy is
automated.

The functionalities involved in this system are :
1) Customers and Delivery Boys have separate logins to access their accounts.
2) Customers login into their account to place their food orders and based on their location it
goes into corresponding delivery boy’s account.
3) Delivery Boys login into their account to view their orders which they need to deliver.
4) Customers can create their own login account using by clicking new registration.
5) Delivery Boys cannot create their account on their own. First they need to send their details
and their resume to administrator. If we like his resume, we hire him and create a new
account to him and share his login credentials to him through mail.
6) In customers account, they can delete their orders, view orders, update profile, view
payments, etc..
7) In Delivery Boy’s account, they can view the orders they got and based on that, they will
deliver the food and after delivering, they can update the delivery status in their account.
